# What does Network Layer do?

## Forwarding
* Direct the packet to the correct interface

---

# What does Network Layer do?

## Routing
* Setting up forwarding tables globally to enable end-to-end communication

---

## Forwarding vs. Routing

|Forwarding|Routing|
|:-:|:-:|
|Data plane|Control Plane|
|Each router does forwarding with its own forwarding table|All routers jointly compute the forwarding tables using a distributed algorihtm|
|Local|Global|
|Fast|Slow|

# How does Network Layer work?
## -- How does IP work?

Let us check from the packet structure.

---

## What is in IP(v4) header?

* Parse packet => **version number**, **packet length**
* Carry packet to the destination => **IP address**
* Deal with problems along the way
	* Corruption => **checksum**
	* Loops => **TTL**
	* Huge packets => **fragmentation fields**
* Other => **Type of Service**, **Options**
