## Before we start

### Delay

* transmission delay = data size / transmission rate
* propagation delay = link length / propagation speed
* queuing delay
* processing delay



### BDP (Bandwidth-Dalay Product)

* BDP = bandwidth * propagation delay
* number of bytes in flight
* difference between bandwidth and transmission rate



## Link Layer

### What does link layer do?

* Provide a well-defined service interface to the network layer
* **End-to-end vs. Hop-by-hop**



#### Sub-layers

- LLC: Logic Link Control (Upper sub-layer ()
  - Error control
    - Error detection and correction (FEC)
    - Gauranteed and in-order delivery (ARQ)
  - Flow control


  - Multiplexing
  - Security
    - Privacy
    - Integrity
    - Authenticaion
- MAC: Mediam Access Control (Lower sub-layer)
  - Framing: Mapping between stream of physical layer bits and frames


- Link maintenance (skipped)
- Timing recovery (skipped)



#### Types of service

- unacknoledged connectionless service (ethernet)
   * used for reliable links or real-time traffice
- acknowledged connectionless service (e.g. 802.11 WiFi)
   * gaurantees delivery
- acknowledged connection-oriented service
   * gaurantees in-order delivery
   * used over long, unreliable links



### Framing

* Byte count / character count
  * Use a field in the header to specify the number of bytes in the frame
  * Problem: the count itself can be garbled => rarely used


* Flag bytes with byte stuffing / character-oriented framing
  * Indidate start and end of frames with flag byte
  * Insert escape before flag bytes in the original data
  * **Binary Synchronous Communication**
    * Start flag: STX
    * End flag: ETX
    * Escape: DLE
  * **Point-to-Point Protocol** (**PPP**)
    * Flag: 0x7E (01111110)
    * Escape: 0x7D (01111101)
    * XOR flag and excape in the original data with 0x20 (00100000)


* Flag bits with bit stuffing ／ bit-oriented framing
  * Developed for **HDLC (High-level Data Link Control)** protocol
  * Indicate start and end of frames with 0111110 (0x7E)
  * Stuff a 0 after 11111 in the original data



#### Generic Framing Procedure

* Synchronization
  * Hunt state
  * Pre-sync state
  * Sync state



### Error Control — ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request)

* ACK & NACK
  * Cumulative ACK: arries the next expected sequence number
  * Selective ACK: acknowledges the received packets


* timer
* sequence number: to deal with duplicates and sliding window


#### Stop-and Wait ARQ

* Transmit and wait for ACK
* Does not work well for high BDP (hish speed or long prog delay)



#### Go-Back N ARQ

* Receiver uses cumulative ack and discards out-of sequence packets

* Retransmit **from** the next expected packet


* For m bit sequence number, Ws <= 2^m



#### Selective Repeat ARQ

* Receiver uses selective ack and buffers out-of-sequence packets

* Retransmit only unack'd packets


* For m bit sequence number, Ws + Wr <= 2^m



#### Sliding Window

Left edge of window

- sender: beginnign of unacked data
- receiver: beginning of expected / undelivered data

Right edge: left edge + const



#### Cumulative ACK vs. Selective ACK

- Cumulative ACK: arries the next expected sequence number
- Selective ACK: acknowledges the received packets
